This Chrome extension gives you a set of hotkeys on the Google Lens interface.
After selecting text, hit one of the following keys to trigger the action

- <kbd>t</kbd> : (T)ranslate the word
- <kbd>s</kbd> : Li(s)ten the word ((s)ound)
- <kbd>c</kbd> : (C)opy the word
- <kbd>a</kbd> : Google im(a)ges the word

Extra :
- <kbd>g</kbd> : (Ji)sho the word (Japanese dictionary)
- <kbd>h</kbd> : MDGB ((H)anzi codex; Chinese and Kanji characters database)

All these keybindings are one-handed-friendly (left).
Once you master the muscle memory, it's just a matter of selecting the text with the right-hand and choosing a shortcut with the left hand.

This extension also removes the stupid "Copy" tag when you select the text.

Well... that's it!
